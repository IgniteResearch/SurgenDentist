You might be surprised to find out how many of them have had cosmetic dental work.That beautiful smile can actually be yours and the quickest way of doing that is to opt for dental Veneers and Laminates.These are wafer-thin shells of tooth-coloured material that are fixed to the front surface of the teeth to improve their cosmetic appearance. They can, not only close the spaces but also can change the shape, shade, and position of the teeth. In fact dental veneers are for your teeth what false fingernails are for your hands!!!

## DENTAL VENEERS / LAMINATE

The cosmetic dentist at FMS can guide you through the dilemma between porcelain & composite veneers/laminate so that you get veneers most ideal for your situation.

**Some of the reasons why patients may opt for treatment with dental veneers are:**

## SPACES BETWEEN THE TEETH

Spaces or gaps between your front teeth also called as diastemas, can easily be closed using dental veneers, giving you a beautifully aligned smile.



## STAINED/DISCOLOURED TEETH

Stains that cannot be removed by cleaning or teeth whitening. In such a case dental veneers or laminates can hide any existing stains on your teeth thus improving the shade.

## BROKEN/DAMAGED TEETH

Teeth that have become badly worn or are chipped/broken, can benefit from veneers. This can be done both with composite bonding as well as porcelain laminates if a more long term solution is required.

## CROOKED TEETH

The ideal treatment for severely crooked teeth would actually be orthodontics or braces. However, such treatments are long term treatments and may go on for a year or more. If the teeth are mildly crooked then veneers can be placed over them to achieve a straight aligned-looking smile.
