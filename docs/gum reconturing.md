## GUM RECONTOURING IS A PROCEDURE

If any of the above reasons causes you to hide your smile or has a negative effect on your self-confidence, affecting your mental welfare, than gum recontouring is a procedure worthy of consideration.

Gum contouring is a procedure which is most commonly done using a scalpel or soft tissue lasers to trim away the excessive gum covering the front teeth. The healing process is relatively quick, but faster if lasers are used. Sometimes reshaping of the gum i s not enough and the cosmetic dentist may have to remove some of the bone surrounding the teeth as well. Bone removal is done only when he biological width of the gums is insufficient as the gums may grow back otherwise.
